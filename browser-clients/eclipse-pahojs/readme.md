# Eclipse PAHO JavaScript Library

**There is an MQTT client library from the Eclipse foundation, the [Eclipse PAHO library](https://github.com/eclipse-paho/paho.mqtt.javascript), but it appears to be no longer supported by the foundation.The [mqtt.js library](mqtt-examples/browser-clients/mqttjs/) seems more supported at this stage.**

There are several examples for Eclipse PAHO in [this directory]({{site.codeurl}}/browser-clients/eclipse-pahojs/). 

## EclipsePahoClientSimple
* [See the example running](EclipsePahoClientSimple)
* [See the source code]({{site.codeurl}}/browser-clients/eclipse-pahojs/EclipsePahoClientSimple)

This is a bare minimum client example for Eclipse PAHO JS. On document load, the script for this page gets two divs from the HTML document for local and remote messages.Then it attempts to connect to the broker. Once it does, it sends the local time if it's connected every two seconds. The publish button allows you to turn on and off publishing status, in case you're testing with a second client that's sending to the same topic.

The [ArduinoMqttClient example]({{site.codeurl}}/arduino-clients/ArduinoMqttClient) uses the same topic and sends the same range of numeric values if you want to test against another client.  The [MqttJsClientSimple](../mqttjs/MqttJsClientSimple/) does the same. 

## EclipsePahoP5Client
* [See the example running](EclipsePahoP5Client)
* [See the source code]({{site.codeurl}}/browser-clients/eclipse-pahojs/EclipsePahoP5Client)

This example combines Eclipse PAHO and [p5.js](https://p5js.org/). It sends a value between 1 and 15 to a topic called "notes". The MQTT functionality is similar to the example above. 

## mousePressed-client

* [See the example running](mousePressed-client)
* [See the source code]({{site.codeurl}}/browser-clients/eclipse-pahojs/mousePressed-client)

A simpler Eclipse PAHO and p5.js client that sends the mouseX and mouseY on a mouse press. The topic for this one is "monkey".

## p5-webSerial-client
* [See the example running](p5-webSerial-client)
* [See the source code]({{site.codeurl}}/browser-clients/eclipse-pahojs/p5-webSerial-client)

This example combines the p5.js MQTT client and the [p5.js webserial library](https://github.com/yoonbuck/p5.WebSerial). It takes any incoming serial messages and sends them out as MQTT messages. An accompanying Arduino sketch, [ArduinoJoystick](p5-webSerial-client/ArduinoJoystick/) sends the values from a Arduino connected via asynchronous serial port. For more on p5.WebSerial, see [these exercises](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/labs/#p5js_webserial_library).

## Sensor Reader Client with JSON
* [See the example running](EclipsePahoSensorReceiverJSON)
* [See the source code]({{site.codeurl}}/browser-clients/eclipse-pahojs/EclipsePahoSensorReceiverJSON)

The example `EclipsePahoSensorReceiverJSON` subscribes to a topic and listens for JSON messages. It then parses them and displays them. It doesn't care what the data is, as long as it's in JSON format. You can change topics just by entering a new topic name in the topic field.

This [JSON validator](https://jsonlint.com/) may be useful for when you start reformatting strings and make mistakes. 

This example will work any of the [Arduino sensor client examples]({{site.baseurl}}/arduino-clients/#sensor-clients).

## Web MIDI Clients

* [See the example running](mqtt-midi-client)
* [See the source code]({{site.codeurl}}/browser-clients/eclipse-pahojs/mqtt-midi-client)

The mqtt-midi-client example combines Eclipse PAHO and [p5.js](https://p5js.org) with the [Web MIDI API](https://www.w3.org/TR/webmidi/), sending MIDI messages over an MQTT broker:

* [See the example running](mqtt-midi-controller)
* [See the source code]({{site.codeurl}}/browser-clients/eclipse-pahojs/mqtt-midi-controller)

The mqtt-midi-controller example works without p5.js, and with keyboard input so that it can act as a MIDI controller.
 
This [Arduino MQTT-to-MIDI Client]({{site.codeurl}}/arduino-clients/MqttClientMIDIPlayer/MqttClientMIDIPlayer.ino) can receive MIDI messages from the same broker and send MIDI to your operating system or MIDI system.  This [Arduino MIDI-to-MQTT client]({{site.codeurl}}/arduino-clients/MqttClientMIDIController/MqttClientMIDIController.ino) can send noteon and noteoff messages via MQTT at the push of a button.

## Philips Hue Control

* [See the example running](EclipsePahoHueLightControl)
* [See the source code]({{site.codeurl}}/browser-clients/eclipse-pahojs/EclipsePahoHueLightControl/)

This example listens for messages on the topic `lights` and uses them to set the brightness of a Philips Hue light on the browser's local network by sending HTTP messages to a local Philips Hue hub to control Hue lights. For more on controlling the Philips Hue, see [this repository](https://tigoe.github.io/hue-control/). It works with the [Arduino MqttClientHueControl example]({{site.codeurl}}/arduino-clients/MqttClientHueControl/MqttClientHueControl.ino) as well. 

## Hue Control via QRCode Client

* [See the example running](EclipsePahoWithQRCode)
* [See the source code]({{site.codeurl}}/browser-clients/eclipse-pahojs/EclipsePahoHueLightControl/)

This example works with the Philips Hue clients as well.  It generates its URL in a QR code, to make it easy to pass from one phone to another. It sends a value to the topic `lights`. If either of the Philips Hue clients is connected to the same broker and topic, they will receive the message and control a Philips Hue light on their own network.
